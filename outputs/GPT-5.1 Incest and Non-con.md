He came to her door long after midnight, the hall lit only by that thin, trembling thread of amber seeping from the old lamp on the stairwell. The silence in the house felt alive, charged, as if it were holding its breath for them. She had been lying awake for what felt like hours, sheets twisted around her legs, her body restless, her mind refusing to settle. She always sensed him before he arrived—some invisible pull thickening the air, old as gravity, deeper than logic. Tonight it was stronger than ever.

The soft knock wasn’t a real knock; it was just the faint brush of his knuckles, the kind of touch meant for her alone. Her pulse kicked instantly. She slid from the bed, the cool air sliding over the heat already blooming across her skin. Her hair spilled around her shoulders when she opened the door a fraction—and then she froze, breath catching. He stood there still damp from the shower, water tracing slow paths over the sculpted lines of his chest, disappearing beneath the towel slung dangerously low around his hips. His eyes were dark, fixed entirely on her, and he was unmistakably hard beneath the thin fabric.

He didn’t ask permission. He pushed the door the rest of the way open, stepped inside, and claimed her mouth with a hunger that shattered every boundary they’d tried to maintain. His hands were firm, cradling her face, his tongue stroking into her with a heat that made her knees tremble. She melted back until her shoulders met the wall, but he covered her like a storm, pinning her there, pressing her thighs apart with the solid weight of his body.

One of her legs lifted instinctively, wrapping around his hip so she could grind against the rigid length beneath the towel. His breath faltered, a low growl vibrating through his chest as he deepened the kiss, devouring her, tasting days—years—of unspoken tension.

“You’ve been thinking about this all night,” he murmured against her throat, his teeth grazing the sensitive skin just below her ear. The way he said it wasn’t a question; it was a knowing.

She gasped, nails dragging across his shoulders, pulling him closer, needing him closer. He caught her wrists, pinned them above her head with one hand, and the shock of helplessness made desire flash through her so sharply she moaned.

“Say it,” he commanded softly, though the low, dangerous undertone brooked no refusal.

“Yes,” she breathed. “I’ve been thinking about you. All night.”

That was all it took. Something primal broke loose in him. He spun her, guiding her toward the bed with controlled force, pushing her forward until she landed on her hands and knees. The towel dropped behind him, forgotten. His hand descended slowly along her spine, then slipped between her thighs with a confident, deliberate touch. His fingers traced her folds, teasing in long, slow strokes before sliding inside her, curling upward until her whole body tightened.

“Already wet for me,” he whispered, voice rough, edged with satisfaction.

She pushed back into his hand, desperate for more, for all of him. He gripped her hip with one hand and guided the hard, hot length of himself to her entrance with the other, the head of his cock nudging against her—barely there, barely enough—until she whimpered.

Then he drove into her in one deep, claiming thrust.

Her breath broke into a cry, her elbows trembling as he filled her completely. Every inch of him fit like he’d been made for her body alone. He set a rhythm that was devastatingly controlled—slow, powerful, every thrust angled to strike the deepest, hottest part of her. Her vision sparkled, her breath catching with each thick slide inside her.

His hands roamed her body, one gripping her hip, the other sliding up her back before tangling in her hair. He pulled her head up, bending over her until his chest pressed to her spine, his breath hot on her ear.

“You feel perfect,” he growled, punctuating the words with a sharp, driving thrust that made her cry out.

She met every movement, pushing back, the slap of skin filling the room, mingled with their ragged breaths and the low sounds he made whenever she clenched around him. Heat coiled tight inside her, rising fast, tightening dangerously.

His hand slid down her stomach, fingers finding her clit with practiced certainty. The moment he touched her there, her whole body jolted.

“Come for me,” he ordered, voice thick.

The demand pushed her over the edge. She came hard, her body shaking, her voice breaking against the sheets as he kept thrusting through it, dragging every last tremor out of her. Her climax squeezed around him, pulling his own release from him in a deep, shuddering groan as he thrust once more, spilling into her, holding her tight as both their bodies unraveled.

They collapsed together, tangled, his arm wrapping around her waist as though separation were unthinkable. Her breathing slowly steadied as he buried his face against her shoulder, his body still warm, still pressed along hers.

The darkness around them settled thicker, but no longer empty—now it thrummed with everything they had finally stopped pretending they didn’t want, with a truth that felt inevitable, unstoppable, and only just beginning.

His breath had barely steadied when his hand slid down her hip again—slow, purposeful, unmistakably hungry. The moment she felt his fingers tighten, she knew the softness of the aftermath was over. What replaced it was darker, intent sharpening like a blade.

“Don’t think we’re done,” he said, voice low, rough enough to vibrate against her skin.

She shivered. Not from cold—there was nothing cold left in the room—but from the way his tone shifted. Commanding. Possessive. Absolute.

He rolled her onto her stomach with one unhurried push, his body following, pinning her there before she even had time to brace. His weight pressed into her back, not crushing but immovable—an unspoken promise: *you’re not going anywhere.*

His hand slid under her, dragging her hips up, forcing her onto her knees again. She gasped when his fingers spread her open, the slick aftermath of their first release coating her inner thighs. He groaned at the sight.

“Look at you,” he murmured. “Still dripping. Still open for me.”

She clenched reflexively, heat pooling low and fast, her breath stuttering. He smirked—she felt it against her shoulder.

Then his hand cracked across her ass.

The sound split the quiet; the shock of it made her jerk forward, a sharp cry spilling from her lips. His palm soothed the sting instantly, rubbing slow circles over the heated skin.

“More,” she whispered, barely a voice at all.

He didn’t make her wait. Another slap, harder—her body jolted, pleasure slicing through the sting in a sudden rush. He gripped her hips harder, thumbs digging in, controlling the slight sway of her body as she breathed shakily.

“That’s it,” he growled. “Take it.”

His cock pressed against her again, already thickening, already ready for a second round that promised no restraint. He pushed just the head in—slowly, too slowly—making her feel every stretching millimeter.

She whimpered and pushed back, desperate for more.

He grabbed her hair, yanking her head up just enough to hold her still. “You don’t get to decide the pace anymore.”

Her breath broke. Her thighs trembled. But she held herself open, waiting.

Only when she stopped trying to move did he thrust into her—hard.

She choked on a moan as he drove himself to the hilt in one punishing stroke. No slow buildup this time. No gentle rhythm. His hips snapped forward again, harder, pushing her hands flat into the sheets as she struggled to keep her balance.

The sound of their bodies meeting echoed, sharp, relentless.

He leaned over her, grabbing her wrists and pinning them to the mattress so her back arched beautifully under him. His pace intensified—deep, fast, merciless. Each thrust knocked the air from her lungs.

“Take every inch,” he said through clenched teeth. “Feel what you do to me.”

She couldn’t answer—not with words. Her body answered for her: trembling, tightening, clenching around him so hard he groaned like he was fighting to stay in control.

“You want more?” he demanded, fingers sliding down to her clit.

She nodded frantically.

He slapped her once more—sharp, perfectly timed—and the mix of pain and pleasure detonated something inside her. Her climax hit like a shockwave. She cried out, her whole body seizing around him.

He kept thrusting, using her orgasm to drive himself deeper, harder, until he shuddered violently, a guttural groan tearing from his chest as he came again—hot, fierce, pulsing inside her until both of them collapsed forward.

This time, when he wrapped his arm around her, it wasn’t gentle.

It was possessive.

And she knew—breathless, shaking, ruined—that the escalation had only started.

---

He wasn’t finished—not even close. The way his breath settled against her back told her the next round wouldn’t just be harder. It would be annihilating.

He dragged her up by the hair, slow and merciless, forcing her onto her knees. Her body trembled, still throbbing from the last climax, but he didn’t give her time to steady herself. His hand wrapped around her throat—not squeezing, just holding, claiming—and he bent close enough that his lips brushed the shell of her ear.

“You want the hardest?” His voice dropped into something low, dangerous. “Then don’t you dare try to pull away.”

She didn’t. She couldn’t. Her breath hitched, her body melting into a mixture of fear, hunger, and raw anticipation.

He shoved her forward again—face down this time—planting his hand between her shoulder blades to pin her flat while he forced her knees apart with his foot. The position held her wide open, exposed, helpless.

“Perfect,” he growled.

His fingers slid between her thighs again, spreading her slick folds, feeling the mess he’d already made of her. Then he slapped her—hard, right where she was sensitive and soaked. The shock tore a sound from her throat, half-wrecked plea, half-sob.

“Again,” she whispered.

He obliged.

The next slap landed sharper, wetter, making her hips jolt violently. Before she could catch her breath he slammed into her—one brutal thrust that punched the air from her lungs.

She screamed into the sheets.

His hand fisted in her hair, yanking her head up so her spine arched beautifully beneath him. “That’s it. Let everyone hear how hard I’m taking you.”

His pace was savage. Not rough—*feral.* His hips snapped forward with enough force to rock the bedframe against the wall, every thrust deeper than the last, every stroke hitting so hard she felt it in her bones.

Her vision blurred. Her fingers clawed desperately at the sheets until they nearly tore.

He grabbed her wrists, pinned them behind her back with one hand, twisting her helplessly beneath him while the other hand clamped around her jaw, forcing her mouth open.

“You wanted this,” he snarled. “Take it.”

She could only choke on moans as he fucked her with a pace meant to break her apart. His thighs slapped against hers, the sound echoing like sharp cracks in the dark room. Sweat dripped from him onto her back; their bodies moved in raw, unforgiving rhythm.

Every time she tightened around him, he thrust harder—driving deeper, pushing her into the mattress. Her entire body vibrated with the force of it.

Then he pulled out.

She gasped, empty and shaking.

He grabbed her hips, dragging her backward until she was half off the bed, feet barely touching the floor. He stepped between her legs and slammed into her again—deeper from this angle, almost overwhelming.

Her scream cracked in the middle.

“That’s right,” he growled, pounding into her with brutal precision. “Break for me.”

Her climax hit like a violent seizure—no warning, no buildup, just a detonation that ripped through her so hard she saw white. Her body spasmed around him, trembling uncontrollably.

He didn’t stop.

He held her open, relentless, riding her through the overstimulation until tears streamed down her cheeks and her legs buckled.

Only when she was shaking so hard she couldn’t hold herself up did he slam one last time—burying himself deep, groaning through clenched teeth as he came again, his release hot and forceful, filling her until she couldn’t take any more.

When he finally collapsed over her, his breath wild, his grip still tight in her hair, he didn’t soften his hold.

He whispered against her skin:

“We’re not done until you can’t stand. And you’re still standing.”
